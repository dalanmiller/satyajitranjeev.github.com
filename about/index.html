    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I love to code. I have been coding from when I was in the fourth grade. It was LOGO then. But from then I have been coding in various languages. BASIC to C, C++, Java, Perl, Php, Python and JavaScript, to name a few, are the languages I have worked with. I am most proficient in Python, which is what I use every day. I like JavaScript and have toyed around with it for quite some time now. The other languages are sitting like dormant volcanoes in my brain waiting to erupt in a new project or so.</p>

    <p>I love to tweak around with computers. I remember my first own computer having 120Mb of hard disk, which I tweaked and eventually crashed. I currently own a MacBook Pro, use OS X Lion on it. Though I find the system to do all what I need my favourite OS would be Fedora, a GNU/Linux flavour, which you might see as the child of the very popular Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I like customizing the things that I work on, even on a Mac I managed to find something to customize.</p>

    <p>I use <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> as my terminal which runs on a zsh. I have configured it using <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">ohmyzsh</a> with gallois as my default theme. I have modified it to fit my needs.</p>

    <p>Text editing should be simple. You should not be jumping from using the keyboard to the mouse to do simple tasks. Your editor should give you all things you need so you don't leave the keyboard. Well that is my way of doing things. And for this I have Vim set up to my comfort. I use <a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim">MacVim</a> and Vim from the terminal. I have two favourite colour schemes. One of them is tutticolori show below.</p>

    <p>And the other is rdark as shown below. I use rdark for the terminal and tutticolori for MacVim. Both of them have been modified. If you like the color scheme you can find it in my <a href="https://github.com/satyajitranjeev/Dotvim">DotVim</a> repository. This repository also holds all my settings and the plugins I use. Feel free to fork it or clone it.</p>
